# Cameron Maclean / BowsiePup

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a general male (he/him) developer with years of experience using multiple languages.

Here are a few of the languages I use:

```asciidoc
- HTML
- SCSS, CSS
- JavaScript, NodeJs, jQuery, TypeScript
- PHP
- Python3
- GoLang
- Bash Scripting
- MongoDB and SQLite for Databasing
```

âš¡ Fun fact: I do many projects with [AstroCoding](https://github.com/AstroCoding "Mark H"), only a few of which are public. My favourite of which is a [Bloons TD 6 autoplay bot](https://github.com/AstroCoding/btd6_autoplay "Click here")


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on enhancing my GoLang skills.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my Discord bot projects! Currently, I'm working on a bot that interfaces with the YouTube API and their push notifications. You can view more information [here](https://top.gg/bot/youtube "YoutubeBot on Top.gg").
